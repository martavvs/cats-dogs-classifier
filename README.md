# cats-dogs-classifier
Implementating of Deep Learning architectures for a classifier of cats vs dogs
### Prerequisites
- Keras
- opencv
- Tensorflow

### Training
The dataset used was the one from a Kaggle machine learning competition (in 2013). In this dataset there are 25,000 labeled images of dogs and cats (12,500 of each class). 
This dataset can be downloaded following by clicking in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data and then in the "Download All" option.
To test it, I used the 12,500 unlabeled photos from the same dataset.
